## General

Analyzing how social media signals from crypto influencers translate into real market movements, AlphaScope is an open-source performance attribution system. AlphaScope offers quantifiable measurements on which sources regularly supply alpha by monitoring mentions across Twitter, Telegram, and other networks.

## Planned Key Features

- **Time-based Performance Analysis**: Monitor token performance at several intervalsâ€”5m, 15m, 30m, 1h, 4h, 1d, 1w, 1Mâ€”after influencer mentions
- **Multi-platform Support**: Examine signals from Twitter, Telegram, Discord, and others across several platforms
- **Statistical Metrics**: Custom scoring systems, Sharpe ratios, average returns, and win rates
- **Influencer Rankings**: Data-driven leaderboards for various trading styles and time frames
- **Visual Dashboards**: Interactive graphs displaying performance trends and comparisons under various time horizons and trading styles constitute visual dashboards
- **Exportable Reports**: Produce thorough JSON/CSV reports for subsequent study under`

## ðŸ“Š Operation

1. **Data Collection**: Compile social media mentions with timestamps for data collecting
2. **Price Correlation**: Using GeckoTerminal's OHLCV data, correlate mentions with following price changes
3. **Performance Calculation**: Calculate returns over several time frames
4. **Statistical Analysis**: Produce thorough performance measures
5. **Ranking & Visualization**: Show practical ideas with simple interfaces

### Price Data Collection

AlphaScope retrieves correct historical price data using GeckoTerminal's free API. We get OHLCV (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) data for every coin mention to determine exact price changes:

```bash curl -X 'GET' 'https://api.geckoterminal.com/api/v2/networks/solana/pools/<POOL_ADDRESS>/ohlcv/day?limit=100&currency=usd' -H 'accept: application/json'```

This lets us:Â 
-Â Get price data up to 6 months in the pastÂ 
-Â Match precise timestamps with social mentions
- Compute precise returns for several time windows
- Assist several networks like Solana, Ethereum, BSC, and others

## Applications

- **Traders**: Find consistent signal sources for various trading tactics
- **Researchers**: Study data flow in cryptocurrency/memecoin/social markets
- **Developers**: Build sentiment-based trading strategies using verified data
- **Platforms**: Improve social trading features using performance measures, platforms

## Technology Stack

- TypeScript
- Node.js
- D3.js/Recharts
- GeckoTerminal API for past pricing data

## Sample Study (Coming Soon)

```typescript
// Example of what AlphaScope will provide in functionality
const performance = analyzer.rankInfluencers(mentions, {
  timeWindow: '1h',
  minMentions: 10
});

console.log(performance[0]);
// {
//   source: '@boosts',
//   avgReturn: 2.3%,
//   winRate: 0.73,
//   sharpeRatio: 1.8,
//   totalMentions: 156
// }

const priceData = await geckoTerminal.getOHLCV({
  network: 'solana',
  poolAddress: 'CBHA6oZc9U3jiw872LnkjY3PkjwEdkENqLLG1QCCcxQe',
  timeframe: 'day',
  limit: 100
});
```
